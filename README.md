# Scraping_Data

The R file attached will scrap data from basketball-reference.com. The data is used in a couple of python notebooks I wrote, as well as the game simulator I am attaching.

The game simulator will take any 2 input teams and give odds of who would win individual games and a 7 game series based on my calculations.

Thanks,

Daniel
